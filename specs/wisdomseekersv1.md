Wisdom Seekers Operations v1.0
DRAFT



Wisdom Seekers -- these are people seeking pricing information.  They are like traditional clients -- they will pay for services provided by the protocol. 

=> These actors must buy LITH in order to pay for the pricing service

Steps:
Wisdom Seekers have a need to price an asset.
They create the question using standard templates from Lithium (TBD)
Alternatively, they can search through live questions and can bid the amount shown to gain first access -- or bid their desired level of access.
When creating the question, they also select an amount they are willing to pay for first access to the question.
They submit their question (either created themselves or found and bid)
=> question submitted

	Current status of bidding is shown to Wisdom Seeker
	This status updates as they get outbid, allowing them to bid higher for first access.

	A timer is set to allow for bidding to increase until a deadline

Bidding process for gaining access to the pricing info earliest

3 hour windows correspond with tiers of bidders.

All bidders are divided into 3 categories by the amount they bid -- highest ⅓, middle ⅓ and lowest ⅓.  

Questions are live for One 8-hour period.  The top bidders (highest ⅓) receive access to the prices at 8-hours, next highest (middle ⅓) receive access at 9-hours, and final bidders (lowest ⅓) receive access at 10-hours.  A one hour time premium on pricing information can be incredibly valuable for certain assets.

After 24-hours have elapsed from the beginning of the period, all pricing information is publicly available.
